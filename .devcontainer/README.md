# .devcontainer — scion maintainer notes

🌱 Quick metaphor (attention)  
This scion is to a repository what a plant scion is to a stock: graft the scion (this Codespace/devcontainer template) into a repo to give it an instant, reproducible development environment.

What’s in the scion (high level)
- devcontainer.json, Dockerfile — container & Codespaces config
- bin/graft.sh — installer/updater script (graft)
- .vscode/ — editor configuration, snippets and stubs (template-managed)
- docs/ — scion-maintainer docs (upgrade guides, internals)
- assets/ — icons and images used in the scion docs

Scion structure (short)

.vscode structure (managed files)
```
.vscode/
├── settings.json         # editor settings (managed with 3-way merge)
├── settings.json.orig    # scion (previous) snapshot
├── launch.json           # debug configurations (managed)
├── launch.json.orig      # scion (previous) snapshot
└── intelephense-stubs/   # PHP stubs for IntelliSense
    └── wp-cli.php        # WP-CLI stubs
```

The `.vscode/` files listed above are **managed by graft.sh** and follow the 3-way merge semantics:
- `.orig` files store the previous scion version for comparison
- Local edits are preserved when they differ from `.orig`
- Interactive prompts let you choose: keep local, accept scion, or merge

All other `.vscode/` files you create are yours and won't be touched by upgrades.

🔁 Upgrade & maintainer quick guide
- Interactive (inside a Codespace) — recommended:
  - `graft upgrade` — interactive update
  - `graft export` — export scion to another repo
  - Aliases: `upgrade-scion`, `export-scion`
- From a workstation:
  ```bash
  curl -L -o ~/Downloads/graft.sh \
    https://raw.githubusercontent.com/evlist/codespaces-grafting/stable/.devcontainer/bin/graft.sh
  chmod +x ~/Downloads/graft.sh
  cd /path/to/your-repo
  bash ~/Downloads/graft.sh      # or: bash ~/Downloads/graft.sh --dry-run
  ```
- Dry-run recommended: `bash bin/graft.sh --dry-run`

⚠️ File replacement behavior during upgrades

**Scion files (.devcontainer/)** — silently replaced:
- Most files in `.devcontainer/` are replaced during upgrades (rsync with `--delete`)
- **Protected files:** `*.local` and `*.local.*` are excluded from sync (your customizations)
- **Protected directories:** `tmp/`, `var/`, and `.cs_env.d/graft.env` are never overwritten

**Managed files (.vscode/)** — interactive merge:
- Files listed above (settings.json, launch.json, stubs) use 3-way merge with `.orig` snapshots
- You get interactive prompts to preserve local changes
- Other `.vscode/` files you create are never touched

Update semantics (.vscode/ managed files)
- New scion file → added and scion (previous) saved as `.orig`.
- Local edits preserved when they differ from `.orig` (interactive choices: keep, replace, backup+replace, save scion sample as `.dist`, or 3‑way merge).
- Scion samples saved as `.dist` when keeping local changes.
- Like Debian's dpkg: `.orig` = previous version, new version compared against local edits.

Troubleshooting tips
- If `git check-ignore` shows required paths are ignored, fix `.gitignore` or run interactively — non‑dry‑run installs abort to avoid hiding scion files.
- Use `.devcontainer/docs/` for step‑by‑step maintainer procedures and to record merging/upgrading policies.

Notes on naming and scope
- Display name: `codespaces-grafting` (short alias: `cs-grafting`). Current implementation and examples target WordPress, but the pattern is generic and reusable for other repositories.
